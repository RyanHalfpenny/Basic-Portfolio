            <p>I am a recent college graduate (Marketing and Business Systems & Analytics ) from La Salle University. I managed to accrue nearly 1 year of work experience. I had the privilege of working for Frank Recruitment Group in a Digital Marketing Recruitment role, where I learned valuable professional skills such as client relations, customer retention, and direct sales. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as hard-working by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven organizational and multitasking skills, which I hope to leverage into a new role. I recently started the Coding Boot Camp at the University of Pennsylvania and hope to equip myself with advanced front and back end coding skills.
